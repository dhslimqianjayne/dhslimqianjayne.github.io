<p>First things first, you have to know more about me... So, here comes my story!
<p>
I am a very sporty person as during Physical Education (PE) in my Primary school days, I loved to play all types of games that were planned
by the PE teachers. I am always a very fair person during the game and I don't cheat. From Primary 1 till Primary 6 there were a total of
24 inter class games day. My class had only won 2 silvers and 22 gold. You might think that I must be joking but its a true fact. As we 
changed class during Primary 3 and 5 ( For Primary 5, there only slight changes in classmates ), I have a total about 2 different classes
during Primary school life, although we were all good friends, we would definitely quarrel many many times when we fight against each other
during a match we play among ourself during PE. But when the real inter class games, you could really see the fire and the teamwork within
us. Although, we were quite sure that we would win, we would always be scared ( especially me since I was the captain for PE in the class )
and we would always protest when we heard that the other girls team from other classes had boys in their team although we knew that they
did not have enough girls... So usually when a match between 2 classes had ended we would usually "high-five" each other. Those who were 
unhappy would slap our hands real hard or avoid our hands, but we did not care, we ran back to our class in glee. Last year, our PE 
teacher had to go to the hospital because of his back injury, but during our last inter class games in Primary school, he came back with a
back guard just to support us. We were all super happy, hence, during the game, we did even more than our best. And yes, we won. I was 
really happy, we all were. When we were calld to receive our medals, I asked my friends to go up first because they deserved it. But
instead, all the PE teachers present and all my classmates had pushed me to the front to receive the medal first. I got teary. It was a 
really proud moment for me when all my flashbacks of my class winning just came into my head. 
I forgot to tell you that I was in the national table tennis kids team when I was in kindergarten. The 2 coaches has came to our school to 
teach us about table tennis and found out I had talent. When they asked us to choose one hand to hold the table tennis racket, I said I
could use both. But I ended up using left hand and I did not realise everyone except me had chosen to use their right hand. This was the
start of my table tennis journey. But unfortunately, I stopped table tennis when I was Primary 2 and left my coaches with sadness. I had
chosen basketaball for my CCA and continued my basketball journey until the end of Primary school.
During Primary 4, there was a trial at Woodlands Singapore Sports School for Junior Sports Academy. About 20 to 30 people were chosen 
from my level to go for the trial. I was one of them. So, my mother said I could just go for the trial for the experience since she 
thought that I would not get selected. Because she thought once I was selected, my parents would have to drive me tp Woodlands every
Saturday. But in the end, only 5 people from my level were selected... and I was one of them too! I was jumping with glee as I thought
of my parents's shocked faces. But so, my parents had no choice but to accept the fact that I was selected but they were happy and proud
of me.So for the next 2 years until Primary 6, I chose four different types of sports. Badminton, Basketball, Wushu and Shooting. 
And that's how JSA has helped in my life, shooting. Shooting had brought me to Dunman High.</p>
