I am a very sporty person as during Physical Education (PE) in my Primary school days, I loved to play all types of games that were planned
by the PE teachers. I am always a very fair person during the game and I don't cheat. From Primary 1 till Primary 6 there were a total of
24 inter class games day. My class had only won 2 silvers and 22 gold. You might think that I must be joking but its a true fact. As we 
changed class during Primary 3 and 5 ( For Primary 5, there only slight changes in classmates ), I have a total about 2 different classes
during Primary school life, although we were all good friends, we would definitely quarrel many many times when we fight against each other
during a match we play among ourself during PE. But when the real inter class games, you could really see the fire and the teamwork within
us. Although, we were quite sure that we would win, we would always be scared ( especially me since I was the captain for PE in the class )
and we would always protest when we heard that the other girls team from other classes had boys in their team although we knew that they
did not have enough girls... So usually when a match between 2 classes had ended we would usually "high-five" each other. Those who were 
unhappy would slap our hands real hard or avoid our hands, but we did not care, we ran back to our class in glee. Last year, our PE 
teacher had to go to the hospital because of his back injury, but during our last inter class games in Primary school, he came back with a
back guard just to support us. We were all super happy, hence, during the game, we did even more than our best. And yes, we won. I was 
really happy, we all were. When we were calld to receive our medals, I asked my friends to go up first because they deserved it. But
instead, all the PE teachers present and all my classmates had pushed me to the front to receive the medal first. I got teary. It was a 
really proud moment for me when all my flashbacks of my class winning just came into my head. 
I forgot to tell you that I was in the national table tennis kids team when I was in kindergarten. The 2 coaches has came to our school to 
teach us about table tennis and found out I had talent. When they asked us to choose one hand to hold the table tennis racket, I said I
could use both. But I ended up using left hand and I did not realise everyone except me had chosen to use their right hand. This was the
start of my table tennis journey. But unfortunately,
